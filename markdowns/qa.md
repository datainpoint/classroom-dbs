# Q&As

Kuo, Yao-Jen <yaojenkuo@datainpoint.com> from [DATAINPOINT](https://www.datainpoint.com/)

### When should I use braces `()`, brackets `[]`, and curly braces `{}`?

- Braces `()`: used for function calls and creating tuples.
- Brackets `[]`: used for extracting elements and creating lists.
- Curly braces `{}`: used for print with format and creating `dict` and `set`.

### Why is indentation so important in Python?

Python does not have the notation for building a struct(or a block). So indentation in Python is not just prettifying our codes, but an essential way to form a struct(or a block).

### What if I'd like to use <https://lab.datainpoint.com> afterwards?

### How to share my Python scripts to my colleagues?

1. Using libraries or packages
    - [Python Packaging User Guide](https://packaging.python.org/)
    - [PyPi](https://pypi.org/)
2. Using executables
    - [PyInstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org/)
3. Using dashboards
    - [Dash](https://plotly.com/dash/)
    - [Streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io/)
    - [Voila](https://github.com/voila-dashboards/voila)
4. Using containers
    - [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
    - [BinderHub](https://mybinder.org/)
5. Using web applications
    - [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/)
    - [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)
    - [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)

### I am still a bit unfamiliar with Python and its application on data science, is it normal?

Totally. Programming can be quite frustrating for newbies, rumor has it we can "master" something within a short period is nonsense. Peter Norvig wrote an article [Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years](https://norvig.com/21-days.html), it is worth reading. Besides, our lecture notes and videos will be permanently hosted on GitHub and YouTube, you can review any topic anytime.

### Where can I go from here?

- We need to START to excel. Programming is similar to math, understanding the theorem and solving the problem are totally irrelevant. Pick a topic and try to implement a solution with Python. Got stuck? Google and StackOverflow are programmer's best buddies.
- Find some time to learn SQL if you've never written a query before. The design of DataFrame class and common analysis framework is highly related to the concept of SQL.
- Automate the boring stuff with Python
- Parsing documents with Python
- Data analysis with Python
- (Optional)Web scraping with Python
- (Optional)Machine learning with Python
- (Optional)Web programming with Python

### Besides Pandas DataFrame and Spark DataFrame, is there any alternatives for analyzing tabular data in Python?

- [datatable](https://datatable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- [Dask](https://dask.org/)

### I am interested in web scraping with Python, what resource do you recommend?

- Web scraping requires basic understanding of web programming. So it is highly suggested to know the entry level of HTML/CSS/JavaScript, the so-called front-end.
- Learn the basics of HTTP requests and the use of browser's developer tools.
- [Learn web development](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn)
- [Requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/)
- [BeautifulSoup4](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/doc)
- [ScraPy](https://scrapy.org/)

### I am also interested in machine learning with Python, what resource do you recommend?

- [Scikit-Learn User Guide](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html)
- [Introduction to Linear Algebra, Fifth Edition (2016) by Gilbert Strang](https://math.mit.edu/~gs/linearalgebra/)
- [The Matrix Calculus You Need For Deep Learning by Terence Parr and Jeremy Howard](https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/)
- [Machine Learning by Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)

### Am I wasting my time since there is nothing relevant to programming in work?

Absolutely NO. Now we understand the fundamental concept and workflow in a data-driven project. We can communicate our requests and specifications with collaborators efficiently.
